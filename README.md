Bombay Bicycle Club's Website


This objective of this project is to create a front-only webpage for a band, namely Bombay Bicycle Club. The client's target audience are their long-standing fans and potential fans that may visit the site. 

This is a single-scrollling page with sections that draw attention to the client's upcoming performances, a selection of the clients back catalog, photographs of the band and their album artwork and a form where fans can contact the band if they want them to perform at their event. 
The Header section of the page idenifies the band and includes links to important social media pages of the band. The Tours section of the page lists the upcoming gigs and festivals that the client is performing at. The Listen section of the page includes embedded videos from YouTube and audio links from Spotify which a fan or new visitor can use to listen to the bands music. The Gallery section is a neat carousel which contains pictures and artwork. The Contact section contains a form that the user can submit a request to the client. 

The navigation of the page can be made through the fixed navigation bar that sits on the bottom of the Header section and on the top of every other section. This leaves a bigger impact on the Header page and makes for easy navigation throughout the pages. 

The Footer contains information on the band members and reiterates the band's presence on social media.

UX

The main goal of this project was to build a website for a band. Regardless of which band I chose, I knew that there are certain features that every band website would want to have. For example, a band will always want to advertise their backcatalog and their upcoming performances. The user will expect to find music and tour dates on a band's website. 

The brief for this project suggested a band which was very popular in the 1960's. Had I chose to progress with this band, the demographic targetted would have been in the 50 year old + bracket. In this case I would have made the website as simple as possible, as an older generation may not be as familiar with navigation through websites. However, I chose a more modern band than the band suggested in the brief. This meant that the demographic targetted with this website are in a younger age bracket, approximately 20-30 year olds, male or female. Regardless the design is a simple, single-scrolling layout with a navigation bar so a user can quickly get to the page area they wish to visit. 

When a person visits a band website, they are usually looking for particular things - tour dates and music. 

As a user interested in finding out when I can see a band, I go to their website so I can find out if they are playing near me, or in a place I'd like to visit. As a user I want this information to be easily found and accessible. A person's initial response to seeing a large header is to scroll down. I placed the Tours section of my band website directly under the opening page area. This reminds the user that the band is touring, and shows them if they will be close to their area soon. As they scroll further, they come across some of the bands best-known songs, another reminder of why they need to buy their concert ticket.

As a user interested in hearing some music of the band, I want their website to showcase their music and then but I also want to be shown where I can hear more. When the user arrives on the opening page area, they are greeted with a row of social media links, including links to music and video sites such as Spotify and YouTube. Clicking on Spotify, for example, will show the user not just a selection of the band's music but all their albums, singles and playlists. They can then follow the band on these platforms, where they will have their whole repertoire at their fingertips. However if they scroll past those initial links, they are met with a selection of music videos and audio clips, taken from YouTube and Spotify, again reminding the user that they can follow the band on these platforms. There are also more links repeated in the footer of the website. 

As a user who may want the band to perform at an event, I want to be able to contact the band or their managers. On this website the user can scroll down to or click Contact to be brought to a form which they can fill out. If the user scrolls down, they will be met with the dates that the band will be unavailable and gigs that the user can attend themselves if they wish to see the band live before their event. They also get samples of their music and pictures of the band so they can see if they are a good fit for their event. 

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features

My project is broken up into 5 distinct page areas - Header, Tours, Listen and Contact. 

The Header is laid out in an eye-catching yet simple way, including the band name and their social media links. In my research I found that many bands targetting a younger audience maintained a very straightforward opening page with their social media links. I followed this style to create a basic opening page area. On desktop and tablet, the user is informed that a new album will be released soon, however I felt it appeared best to remove this from the mobile display. 
As the user scrolls down, they are met with the navbar which is fixed on the bottom of the header and on the top of each other section. This way a user can easily navigate the site if they wish to immediately arrive at a certain point. It will also bring them back up to the top of the website. 

The Tours page area is made up of a timeline list of tour dates for the band, which include the date of the perfomance, the venue and the location. Opposite this timeline there are images of the band performing live, to give the user a taste of what is in store. 

The Listen page area is where the user can listen to a selection of the bands music. There are 3 YouTube videos from 3 different albums so the user can see their music videos and get a taste of each song. Below that there are 4 audio clips from Spotify. These song snippets entice the user to open the bands page on Spotify and will lead the user to following the band. 

The Gallery page area contains examples of album artwork and photographs of the band. 

The Contact page is a straightforward contact form where the user is encouraged to get in touch if they want the band to perfrom at their event. 

There is also a footer which contains a brief overview of the band and the links to the client's social media are repeated.

Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. 
Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, 
with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and 
explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. 
A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

-------------------------------
Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
