# Bombay Bicycle Club's Website


This objective of this project is to create a front-only webpage for a band, namely Bombay Bicycle Club. The client's target audience are their long-standing fans and potential fans that may visit the site. 

This is a single-scrollling page with sections that draw attention to the client's upcoming performances, a selection of the clients back catalog, photographs of the band and their album artwork and a form where fans can contact the band if they want them to perform at their event. 
The Header section of the page idenifies the band and includes links to important social media pages of the band. The Tours section of the page lists the upcoming gigs and festivals that the client is performing at. The Listen section of the page includes embedded videos from YouTube and audio links from Spotify which a fan or new visitor can use to listen to the bands music. The Gallery section is a neat carousel which contains pictures and artwork. The Contact section contains a form that the user can submit a request to the client. 

The navigation of the page can be made through the fixed navigation bar that sits on the bottom of the Header section and on the top of every other section. This leaves a bigger impact on the Header page and makes for easy navigation throughout the pages. 

The Footer contains information on the band members and reiterates the band's presence on social media.

## UX

The main goal in the design of this project was to build a website for a band that was easily navigated while minimalistically designed. Regardless of which band I chose, I knew that there are certain features that every band website would want to have. For example, a band will always want to advertise their backcatalog and their upcoming performances. The user will expect to find music and tour dates on a band's website. 

The brief for this project suggested a band which was very popular in the 1960's. Had I chosen to progress with this band, the demographic targetted would have been in the 50 year old+ bracket. In this case I would have made the website as simple as possible, as an older generation may not be as familiar with navigation through websites. However, I chose a more modern band than the band suggested in the brief. This meant that the demographic targetted with this website are in a younger age bracket, approximately 20-30 year olds, male or female. Regardless the design is a simple, single-scrolling layout with a navigation bar so a user can quickly get to the page area they wish to visit. 

When a person visits a band website, they are usually looking for particular things - tour dates and music. 

As a user interested in finding out when I can see a band, I go to their website so I can find out if they are playing near me, or in a place I'd like to visit. As a user I want this information to be easily found and accessible. A person's initial response to seeing a large header is to scroll down. I placed the Tours section of my band website directly under the opening page area. This reminds the user that the band is touring, and shows them if they will be close to their area soon. As they scroll further, they come across some of the bands best-known songs, another reminder of why they need to buy their concert ticket.

As a user interested in hearing some music of the band, I want their website to showcase their music and then but I also want to be shown where I can hear more. When the user arrives on the opening page area, they are greeted with a row of social media links, including links to music and video sites such as Spotify and YouTube. Clicking on Spotify, for example, will show the user not just a selection of the band's music but all their albums, singles and playlists. They can then follow the band on these platforms, where they will have their whole repertoire at their fingertips. However if they scroll past those initial links, they are met with a selection of music videos and audio clips, taken from YouTube and Spotify, again reminding the user that they can follow the band on these platforms. There are also more links repeated in the footer of the website. 

As a user who may want the band to perform at an event, I want to be able to contact the band or their managers. On this website the user can scroll down to or click Contact to be brought to a form which they can fill out. If the user scrolls down, they will be met with the dates that the band will be unavailable and gigs that the user can attend themselves if they wish to see the band live before their event. They also get samples of their music and pictures of the band so they can see if they are a good fit for their event. 

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

My project is broken up into 5 distinct page areas - Header, Tours, Listen and Contact. 

The Header is laid out in an eye-catching yet simple way, including the band name and their social media links. In my research I found that many bands targetting a younger audience maintained a very straightforward opening page with their social media links. I followed this style to create a basic opening page area. On desktop and tablet, the user is informed that a new album will be released soon, however I felt it appeared best to remove this from the mobile display. 
As the user scrolls down, they are met with the navbar which is fixed on the bottom of the header and on the top of each other section. This way a user can easily navigate the site if they wish to immediately arrive at a certain point. It will also bring them back up to the top of the website. 

The Tours page area is made up of a timeline list of tour dates for the band, which include the date of the perfomance, the venue and the location. Opposite this timeline there are images of the band performing live, to give the user a taste of what is in store. 

The Listen page area is where the user can listen to a selection of the bands music. There are 3 YouTube videos from 3 different albums so the user can see their music videos and get a taste of each song. Below that there are 4 audio clips from Spotify. These song snippets entice the user to open the bands page on Spotify and will lead the user to following the band. 

The Gallery page area contains examples of album artwork and photographs of the band. 

The Contact page is a straightforward contact form where the user is encouraged to get in touch if they want the band to perfrom at their event. 

There is also a footer which contains a brief overview of the band and the links to the client's social media are repeated. 

------------------------
### Existing Features

Navbar - This feature allows the user to immediately find what they are looking for, if they do not want to scroll down the page. It is also fixed, so if they do decide to keep scrolling they can easily click on the navbar items to find their desired section. It condenses into a toggler icon when a mobile or tablet is used, helping the screen appear less condensed. 

...

Images - The images on the page allow the users to get a sense of the band's style when performing live and in person, along with their art style used in their album artworks. 

...

Contact Form - The contact form at the end of the webpage includes a CTA to 'Get in touch' with the band members regarding having them play live. If a user wishes to have the band at their event, they can simply fill out the form with their name, email and message and this can be sent to the band. 

...

Social Media - There are social media icons/links integrated into the website, at the beginning of the site and in the footer. This allows users to gain more information about the band by clicking these links and following them on social media. 

...

Media - The media or 'Listen' section of the website allows the user to see and hear videos and clips from the bands catalog without having to leave the page. However if they would like more videos or audio they can access them via the social links or get onto Spotify through the audio clips. 

...

Responsive - This website has been made responsive so it allows the user to access this page through their mobile, tablet or desktop and have a pleasant user experience each time. 

...

### Features Left to Implement

In the future, I would like to add more features to this website, such as: 

A merchandise store - I believe an online shop where fans can buy their music (CDs and vinyls) and their merchandise such as t-shirts and tote bags would be a good addition to the website. In researching other band websites, I found many of them had this option and I would like to implement this in the future.

A News Section - As the band grows and gets more popular, I would like to include a section with news about the band, such as new music releases or record deals. 


### Another feature idea

An option to sign up for email updates - I would like to add a CTA where users can input their email address and become part of a mailing list for band news and tour updates.

## Technologies Used

#### HTML
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML

HTML was used as it is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications and a great place to start on my first milestone project. 

#### CSS
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets

Cascading Style Sheets are used to describe the appearance of a website and I used it to make my website look appealing to a user. 

#### Bootstrap v4.0 
https://getbootstrap.com/

Bootstrap is a very useful resource as you can save time writing code by using the Bootstrap predefined design templates. It has a great grid system and is responsive to different screen resolutions. I used it in particular in creating the carousel and in the layout of the music video section. 

#### JQuery
https://jquery.com/

The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

#### JS
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/

Many of Bootstrap's components require the use of JavaScript to function. Specifically, they require jQuery, Popper.js, and our own JavaScript plugins.

#### Font Awesome
https://fontawesome.com/

Font Awesome is a great library of icons. I used this library for my social media icons.

#### Google Fonts
https://fonts.google.com/

There is a great selection of fonts in the Google Fonts library, some of which I used in my project.

## Testing

The user story of a fan interested in seeing the band live achieved the intended outcome of providing them with a list of tour dates and links to social media. They can read up on the Tours section and if they are on desktop or tablet they can also see photos of the band performing live. 

The user story of the fan interested in hearing some music from the band achieved the intended outcome. The user can access a selection of music videos and audio in the Listen section. They can also hear music by following the Spotify and YouTube links where they will find a larger selection, if not all, of the bands repertoire. I tested the YouTube videos and clips on different screen sizes and they all worked well. On the mobile, the videos sat slightly to the left as opposed to the center, so this took a little tweaking to make it look more attractive. I manually tested each of the links to the band's social media accounts and each of these opened on a separate tab (due to using 'target="_blank"') to the correct destination. 

The user story of the fan who wants the band to perform at their event achieved the intended outcome. They can fill in the contact form at the bottom of the page. If you try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address. The 'required' attribute has been added to the 'name,' 'email,' and 'event description' fields, so if those fields are not filled in, the form will not submit. If all field are valid, the page will reload. 

I believe my project allows the user to achieve their goals in an easy, straightforward and pleasant way. On different screen sizes and browsers, the project looks good. I removed some text and images from the mobile screen size and from tablet sizes to make things look more attractive and less condensed for the user.



In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

-------------------------------
Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
